# # Towers of Hanoi
author: MilisavljeviÄ‡ Katarina

# Description:

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a stack in ascending order (the smallest at the top). The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
*   Only one disk can be moved at a time.
*   Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
*   No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
